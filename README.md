_**A site used to generate gifs based off of the search entered into the search-bar, 10 at-a-time.  Also added a rating filter to make this site more family friendly by only allowing up to PG ratings on GIF searches.**_

When you search for gifs, it creates a quick-link button that you can re-use again-and-again.

Clicking on thumbnails will toggle, on-and-off, the gifs playing.
