A site used to generate gifs based off of the search entered into the search-bar, 10 at-a-time.
  * When you search for gifs, it creates a quick-link button that you can re-use again-and-again.
  * Clicking on thumbnails will toggle, on-and-off, the gifs playing.

_Technologies used:_
  * API calls
  * Javascript

#### Improvements to be made:
  * _Need to clear out gifs when new button is pressed._
  * _Still wanting to clean up layout a bit._
