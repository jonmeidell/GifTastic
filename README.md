# GifTastic

A site used to generate gifs based off of the search entered into the search-bar, 10 at-a-time.  When you search for gifs, it creates a quick-link button that you can re-use again-and-again.

_Uses **API calls** and **Javascript**._

#### Improvements to be made:
  * _Need to clear out gifs when new button is pressed._
  * _Still wanting to clean up layout a bit._
